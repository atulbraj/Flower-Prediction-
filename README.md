# Flower-Prediction- 
Here I have used CNN for the flower recognition system and cut down some layers for reducing the complexity, used Keras also used GELU activation function for better results. The training and testing is done. Currently i have performed for 10 Epoch and it should actually be performed for more epoch to get the desired accurate results.

Dropout can be neglected but i have done to improve the accuracy. That's totally optional.
